# 🛡️ Mask Detection using TensorFlow

## 📖 Overview

This project leverages TensorFlow to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of classifying images into two categories:

- **Mask** 😷
- **No Mask** 🙅‍♂️

The model is trained on a labeled dataset and thoroughly evaluated for accuracy and performance.

Explore the dataset used in this project on Kaggle: [Face Mask Dataset by Omkar Gurav](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset).
